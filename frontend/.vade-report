# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully integrated Vercel Speed Insights into the React + Vite application to enable real-time performance monitoring.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **src/App.jsx** - Added SpeedInsights component integration

## Implementation Details

### What was added:
1. **Import Statement**: Added `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react";` to the imports section
2. **Component Integration**: Added `<SpeedInsights />` component within the main App component, placed inside the BrowserRouter and AuthProvider context to ensure it tracks all routes

### Why this approach:
- The `@vercel/speed-insights` package was already present in package.json (version ^1.3.1)
- Used the React-specific import (`@vercel/speed-insights/react`) which is the recommended approach for Vite + React projects
- Placed the component at the app root level to ensure it tracks performance across all routes
- Positioned inside AuthProvider to ensure it has access to the application context

### Build Verification:
- Successfully ran `npm install` to ensure dependencies are properly installed
- Build completed successfully using `npm run build`
- No build errors or warnings introduced
- Application compiles to production bundle without issues

## Next Steps (Manual - Not Automated)
To complete the Speed Insights setup:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. Verify the `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script is loaded in the browser
4. Monitor performance metrics in the Speed Insights dashboard after deployment

## Technical Notes
- This is a React application using Vite as the build tool
- The app uses React Router for routing with protected and public routes
- The SpeedInsights component will automatically track page views and performance metrics once deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required as the component uses default settings
